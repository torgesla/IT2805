			<p><strong>My coding skills:</strong> I've coded for three years here at NTNU, in addition I coded some when I was a child and during high school. Mostly Python and Java</p>
			<p><strong>My expecations:</strong> I expect to learn skills for creating interactive websites. I've almost never worked front-end, so I'm exicted to learn this. </p>
			<p><strong>My first impression</strong> of this course is that it is focused on students who has never worked with web technologies before, not one of the harder courses at NTNU by any means,this suites me well.   </p>
